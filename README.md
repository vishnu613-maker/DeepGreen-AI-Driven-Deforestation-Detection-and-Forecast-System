# DeepGreen-AI-Driven-Deforestation-Detection-and-Forecast-System
ðŸŒ¿About the Project:
DeepGreen is an AI-powered platform designed to monitor and analyze deforestation patterns in the Amazon rainforest. Using satellite imagery and advanced deep learning models (CNN-LSTM), the project tracks vegetation changes, detects early signs of deforestation, and forecasts future risks.

ðŸŽ¯Purpose of the Project:
Detect and monitor deforestation in near real-time.
Provide visual insights for researchers, policymakers, and conservationists.
Support biodiversity preservation and climate change mitigation.
Forecast environmental trends such as vegetation loss, rainfall, and temperature patterns.
